# ☕ Krishan's Java DSA Experiments

👋 Hi, I'm Krishan! I'm currently learning the core concepts of **Java**, **C**, and **Python**, and this repository is my hands-on space to explore **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in **Java**.

This repo complements my C-based DSA work and marks the beginning of my transition into object-oriented programming and real-world applications using Java.

---

## 📘 What's Inside

### 🔢 Array Operations
- `arrayinput.java` – Accept and store array elements from user input  
- `arraydeletion.java` – Delete elements from an array  
  *(More array utilities coming soon!)*

### 🔍 Searching Algorithms
- `linearsearch.java` – Simple linear search implementation  
- `binarysearch.java` – Binary search using recursion  

---

## 🚀 Learning Goals

- Strengthen my understanding of **Java syntax and structure**
- Apply DSA concepts in an **object-oriented** way
- Compare implementations across **C and Java**
- Build beginner-friendly projects and reusable code snippets
- Eventually expand into **linked lists**, **trees**, and **sorting algorithms**

## ⚠️ Note

This is a learning-focused repository. Some solutions may be inefficient or contain bugs—I'm always open to feedback! Feel free to open an issue or suggest improvements.

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

- Inspired by tutorials from [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/index.htm) and other online resources  
- Thanks for checking out my Java journey 😊

## 💡 Future Plans

- Add more sorting techniques (selection, insertion, merge sort)  
- Implement stack and queue operations in Java  
- Organize code into packages for better scalability  
- Create mini-projects like expense trackers and file organizers
